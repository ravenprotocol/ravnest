Ravnest is an asynchronous decentralized training framework for large modern deep learning models that harnesses the compute power of regular heterogeneous PCs with limited resources connected across the internet to achieve favourable performance metrics. It enables decentralized training by effectively grouping compute nodes into clusters with comparable data transfer speeds and computing capabilities, eliminating the need for each node to host the entire model.

   Ravnest is in the throes of active development. Brace yourselves for updates! What you see today may not be what you encounter tomorrow. üå™Ô∏è
