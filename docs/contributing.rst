=======================

**1. Open an issue**

We recommend opening an issue (if one doesn't already exist) and discussing your intended changes before making any changes. We'll be able to provide you feedback and confirm the planned modifications this way.

**2. Make code changes**

To make modifications to the code, you must fork the repository. 

**3. Create a pull request**

Once the change is complete, submit a pull request to the master branch from your fork's branch.

**4. Merging**

We will review the code changes and merge the pull request.
